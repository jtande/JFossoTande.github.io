subtitle: Jacob Fosso Tande, Computational Scientist

<p style="text-align: justify">
I am a computational scientist specialized in computing for curricular
and research activities. In my day to day interactions, I act as an interface
between the Information Technology department and the academic departments
at my institution. As a research computing specialist, I advise researchers
on computing needs, design, set up and maintained computing and information
systems for scientific discovery. With the ever changing technological
landscape, I keep abreast of the latest developments and organize workshops
to update researchers on these new developments.

My <em>metamorphic</em> path to become a computational scientist passed
through the mastery of fundamental principles of the physical sciences. I
studied Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry and Computer programming.

With the understsanding of basic concepts, theories and principles at hand, I
then embarked on a journey of scientific discovery, where, I used commodity
and high performance computers along with scientific applications to
investigate atomic and electronic processes of molecules and materials.

In the course of my scientific inquisitions, I worked collaboratively, with
experimentalists and theoreticians across many areas of the physical sciences.
During this process, I developped a passion for setting up computing
insfrastructures, interpreting computational output to provide experimentalists
with insight into experimental observations, trouble-shoot computers attached to
scientific instruments, became accustomed to interpreting scientific jargon
accross disciplines and most important, I developped a "can do" mindset that
keeps me doing what I love to do now
