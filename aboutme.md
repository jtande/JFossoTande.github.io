---
 I am computational Scientist with roots in chemistry.
 I hail from the West region of the Republic of Cameroon.
 I speak three languages, Ngemba, French and English, and
 I hold a bachelor of science in chemistry from the University
 of Buea in the South West Region of Cameroon. I am very happy
 that East Tennessee State University, with the precious help of
 Prof. Huang, gave me the opportunity to study in the US.
